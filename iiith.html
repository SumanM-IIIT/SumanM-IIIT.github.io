				<h2>Life @IIIT-Hyderabad:</h2>
				<p>&emsp;It is one of the dream institutes to study in India for Computer Science students and I feel so lucky that I was able to
				clear the GATE-2020 and IIITH-PGEE 2020 examinations to get admission here for M.Tech in CSIS branch. It's been only about 2 months
				here for me in this institute but I can already feel why this institute is so highly rated. It has taken the computer science engineering
				to a whole new level.
				</p>
				<p>&emsp;The academic curriculum is very different from other institutes and it actually helps the students to be more creative and
				and study hard everyday. IIIT-H has a great culture of Competiitive coding which helps the students to learn the concepts with a
				practical approach. The professors and Teaching Assistants are extremely talented, knowledgable and helpful. Though this institute
				is a primarily a world class research institute, but it also gives a lot of job opportunities to the students in the World's top most IT
				companies as well.
				</p>
				<p>&emsp;I am still a very new to this institute and haven't even explored the campus because we are having online classes due to the 
				Covid-19 pandemic. But so far, the environment is very healthy and competitive and I am enjoying it.
